Thread priority

bydefault - thread number is  5

t1.setPriority(num);
t1.getPriority();


------------------------------------------------------------
-> synchronizing multiple thread in java(Intera thread communication)

Issue - in multi threading two or more thread within a 
program access or try to access same resource.


 eg : Banking system

 suitation - two thread(person) are access same account 
 and they without draw money at same time - possibility
 of data loos.

 -> here come the synchronizing


 import java.util.Scanner;

class Account {

private int bal;

public Account(int bal){
	this.bal = bal;
}

public boolean isBalance(int w){
	
	if(bal > w)
		return (true);
	else
		return false;
}

public void withdraw(int amt)
{
	bal = bal -amt;
	System.out.println("Withdraw money is " + amt);
	System.out.println("Your balance is " + bal);

	}
}

class Customer implement Runnable{

	private Account acc;
	public Customer(Account acc)
	{
		this.acc = acc;
	}

	public void run(){
	Scanner kb = new Scanner("Enter amount to withdraw");
	int amt = kb.nextInt();

	if(acc.isBalance(amt);
	{
		acc.withdraw(amt);
	}

	else
		System.out.println("Insufficient Balance");
	}
}
